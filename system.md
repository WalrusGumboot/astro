# Hymn of Aldebaran (1866)

To Mary, who has been indispensable throughout the process of gathering the necessary information.

## Foreword

The astrological science knows an extensive history. From Babylonian compendia detailing the then known stars to Talmudic interpretations, man has long known that the stars have influence on our worldly goings-on. I propose a new reading of this literature, for it is written herein the truth behind most systems seen thus far. Namely, akin to five painters all attempting to give an accurate representation of the same still life, one needs to consider that every painter has his own artistic vision and, when putting the five paintings side by side one will certainly be able to see similarities but also most certainly differences. In much the same way, Hebrew, Babylonian and Chinese astrological systems all show an amount of overlap but more pressingly a great amount of difference between the three. Should I go to the modern astrologer and get a reading detailing the great amounts of good fortune that await me and the very same day visit the Chinese practitioner who warns me of the great dangers that the future bring me? Surely one of them must be incorrect; the alternative is that one takes the Kierkegaardian leap of faith and dismiss the incompatibilities of the systems away.

This book is an attempt to categorise and to aid understanding; an attempt which is futile if one does not approach it with the care it needs. A preliminary knowledge of the Hebrew Bible is useful, as is that of Kabbalah. An open mind with regard to esoteric knowledge and Gnosticism is of utmost importance.
