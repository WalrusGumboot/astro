# Hymn of Aldebaran

To Mary, who has been indispensable throughout the process of gathering the necessary information.

## Foreword

The astrological science knows an extensive history. From Babylonian compendia detailing the then known stars to Talmudic interpretations, man has long known that the stars have influence on our worldly goings-on. I propose a new reading of this literature, for it is written herein the truth behind most systems seen thus far. Namely, akin to five painters all attempting to give an accurate representation of the same still life, one needs to consider that every painter has his own artistic vision and, when putting the five paintings side by side one will certainly be able to see similarities but also most certainly differences. In much the same way, Hebrew, Babylonian and Chinese astrological systems all show an amount of overlap but more pressingly a great amount of difference between the three. Should I go to the modern astrologer and get a reading detailing the great amounts of good fortune that await me and the very same day visit the Chinese practitioner who warns me of the great dangers that the future bring me? Surely one of them must be incorrect; the alternative is that one takes the Kierkegaardian leap of faith and dismiss the incompatibilities of the systems away.

This book is an attempt to categorise and to aid understanding; an attempt which is futile if one does not approach it with the care it needs. A preliminary knowledge of the Hebrew Bible is useful, as is that of Kabbalah. An open mind with regard to esoteric knowledge and Gnosticism is of utmost importance.

If you are willing to discard your old ideals, to refrain from clinging to archaic and provably false ideologies, this book will aim to be a knowledgeable father holding your hand whilst you walk along the path of true knowledge. It is still required of *you*, dear reader, that you walk this path. Venture outward, and let not the trodden path keep you from exploring the surrounding area. If you are not willing, however, this book will only combat you. It is best to leave right away.

## A Hymn to Aldebaran; or What To Make Of The Thistle

Let us consider first and foremost the underpinning of this new system, for without it we are without map.

To Hermes Trismaegistos! We seek the root of astrological gnosis; what better place to look then towards the literal root, or in Arabic *bahman*. From this word we derive two important concepts: both the Behenian stars, whose power Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa described in his *De Occulta Philosophia Libri Tres* and indeed attributes to Trismaegistos, and the Persian word bahman, referring to a species of rice grass (specifically *Stipa capensis* as described by Carl Peter Thunberg in 1794 in his *Prodromus Plantarum Capensium*. This plant played an important role in ancient Persian celebrations.

The aforementioned Behenian stars are of great importance. The main material of interest can be found in chapters XLVII and LII of the Liber Secundum, more precisely pages CLXXXVIII and CXCVL - CXCVIL. It is written:

> Sub Aldeboram faciebant imaginem ad ſimilitudinem Dei, uel uominis uolatis: confert diuinitas & honorem.

This translates to "Under Aldeboram, they made an image in the likeness of God, or of men who were clothed: it confers divinity and honour." From this we learn one thing and one thing alone: through Aldeboran, we can achieve an image in the likeness of God. Make no mistake; this "Dei" refers to the neoplatonistic idea of the One as seen by Plotinus, or hermetic Qaballistic idea of *Ain Suph Aur* (אין סוף אור).

What, then, is there to learn about Aldeboram? Further in the *Libri Tres* we find information about the symbolic value of this star. Modern astronomy teaches us quite a bit of information about Aldebaran, too; it is more commonly known as *alpha Tauri* since it is the brightest star visible in the Taurus constellation. Its name is derived from the Arabic word الدبران, meaning "the follower"; this is because it follows the Pleiades in the sky. Following observations from Edmund Halley, it can be calculated that approximately five thousand years ago, the vernal equinox precession lined up fairly exactly with Aldebaran. We should also consider the fact that, when looking at the red-light stars bright enough to be seen at dawn, only Antares and Aldebaran are in a position such that they may be visible in the Babylon of 2300 BCE and since these stars are almost diametrically opposed it can be stated that Aldebaran is the solution to the Murbak mystery, which in and of itself has ties to Jupiter.
